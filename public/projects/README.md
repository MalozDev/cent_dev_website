## üé® Placeholder Behavior

Currently, if an image is not found, the portfolio card will display:

- A placeholder icon (ImageIcon from Lucide)
- A gradient background overlay
- All other project information (title, description, tech stack)

The site will still work perfectly even without images, but adding real project images will significantly improve the visual appeal.
